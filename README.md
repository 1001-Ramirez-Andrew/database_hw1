# database_hw1

Database Design:
The Datbase is designed with directory and file implementation. In this implementaiton, Databases are Directories that exist in the same directory as the main.py program.
Tables are implemented as files that exist inside their corresponding Database directories. The varaible and variable types for a table are stored as an n-tuple string in the first line of the file.
Database and Table names in the file system are exactly as users eneter them in the program. Multiple Databases(directories) exist inside the directory that the main.py program is run. Multiple Tables(files) exist inside the their Databse Directory.
